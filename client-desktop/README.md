## Development

### Getting started

1. Before you get started, make sure to fill create your own `.env` file using `.env.example` as a template.

   > **Note: Any changes to the `.env` file require a restart of the development server.**

2. Install dependencies

```sh
> npm install
```

3. Start the React development server

```sh
> npm start
```

4. In _another_ terminal, start electron

```sh
> npm run electron
```

### Developer Tools

To open the developer tools look for them in the Application Menu under **Development**, or use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd`+`Shift`+`I` (on Mac OS X) or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`I` (on Windows)
